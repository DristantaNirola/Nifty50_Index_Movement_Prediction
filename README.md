# Nifty50_Index_Movement_Prediction
## What is Nifty?   
National Stock Exchange Fifty or Nifty is the market indicator of NSE. It ideally is a collection of 50 stocks but presently has 51 listed in it. It is also referred to as Nifty 50 and CNX Nifty by some as it is owned and managed by India Index Services and Products Ltd. (IISL).   
## How is Nifty index calculated?   
Nifty is also calculated through the free-float market capitalization weighted method. Just like Sensex, Nifty also follows a mathematical formula based to know the market capitalization. It multiples the Equity capital with a price to derive the market capitalization. To determine the Free-float market capitalization, equity capital is multiplied by a price which is further multiplied with IWF which is the factor for determining the number of shares available for trading freely in the market. The Index is determined on a daily basis by taking into consideration the current market value divided by base market capital and then multiplied by the Base Index Value of 1000.
##  Objective : 
* ### The problem is to predict the direction of nifty index movements in the next N days (throughout our experiments N can take values 1, 5, and 30). Initially, we will take N=1, that means we want to predict the NIFTY 50 index movement in the next day

* ### This is a classification task where there are two possible outcomes (either the index went up in the next day or it went down).
